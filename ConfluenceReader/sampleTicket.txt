*Answer:
*
Hey Milan, 

Are you still seeing this error at Flatiron? Has it affected any other kiosk devices, or still just this one?

We determined that it is indeed a Square issue. Koala tells me that Square is recommending to update to their Square Reader SDK v1.4.9 as a potential solution. (Deep kiosk is currently running v1.4.4.)

Koala is planning to update their kiosks to v1.4.9 by end of July. We'll need to look into it to determine level of effort and timing, as well as potential risks/side effects, on our side too. Just wanted to check to see if the error is persisting as of today, or if you were able to get past in in the last few days.

Thank you,
Dan

*Solution: update from Square Reader SDK v1.4.4 to Square Reader SDK v1.4.9 deployed on Aug 13th*

Summary: [Mobile] Replace koala.fuzzhq.com domain with koala.io for API calls in pre-prod envs
Description: _From Koala:_

Koala is deprecating all services using the `koala.fuzzhq.com` domain so anything relying on that domain for API calls or similar network services will stop working. On most apps this will manifest itself as a certificate error (e.g. “An SSL error has occurred and a secure connection to the server cannot be made.“) which will crash all API calls.

We have already started to deprecate all `koala.fuzzhq.com` services running on non-production environments to proactively surface integration issues. 

*We will deprecate production services on on 10/14/2021, at which point all apps using the old domain will stop working. We recommend updating all services by replacing `koala.fuzzhq.com` with `koala.io`*

Summary: [Kiosk] Allow user to enter promo code at checkout
Description: *Goal*:

Allow kiosk customers to enter a promo code to receive a discount on their order at checkout.


*Requirements*:

Kiosk customers can add a promo code to their to-stay or to-go order during the kiosk checkout flow.

# User can enter a code in a text field on the Review Order/Checkout screen.
## Tapping in the Promo Code field will launch the keyboard.
## Apply button is inactive until user enters at least 1 character in the Promo Code field.
# When user taps Apply CTA, then the kiosk will validate promo code with Olo.
## If the promo code is not valid, then the promo code will not be applied and the following error message will be displayed: “Coupon code can not be applied.”
## If the promo code is valid, then the discount will be displayed with the order Subtotal and the value will be deducted from the Total Due amount. The Promo Code field will keep the promo code visible and and the Apply button will change state to Remove.
# If user taps Remove CTA on the promo code field, then the promo code will be removed from the order. The discount will be removed from the order subtotal, and the promo code text field will be empty, with inactive Apply CTA.
## User can choose to enter a new promo code in the empty promo code field.

*Considerations*:

* Promo codes will be generated from Olo.

* Promo codes for kiosk orders requires new designs for checkout flow.
* In order to develop, test, and launch this feature, promo codes must be activated in Olo.

Summary: Do not send mobile number to Punchh if user does not exist
Description: At the start of the checkout flow, user is required to enter Mobile Number on the "My Info" screen.

*Problem*:
If the user's phone number is not attached to a Deep loyalty account, then Punchh will create a "dummy" account using their phone number and the user will not be able to create their own Deep loyalty account after that. 

*Goal*:
Do not send user's phone number to Punchh with the order if it is not already attached to a Deep loyalty account, to therefore prevent creation of a dummy account.

Punchh confirmed that we can look up users by phone number via the Punchh API.

*Considerations*:
* Is the kiosk allowed to operate with Loyalty enabled, but not send a phone number some of the time? (This is what we are attempting, only sending phone numbers to the Koala API that already appear in Punchh.)
* What does a guest user see on receipt screen, if they do not have a loyalty account and therefore did not earn any loyalty points?

_From Milan:_
Usually we get an error message before the Square payment page, why is it now the Olo message occurs after the Square payment step? This causes the card to be accidentally charged.

Summary: Kiosk checkout > user has to tap "Receipt sent" screen on confirmation to finish order 
Description: _Reported by Milan 10/27:_

Another weird issue we are now having with the kiosk on the right: When a customer inserts their card and it is approved, with the checkmark, it now stays on that screen. It doesn't automatically send the order to the POS. We have to tap the screen again to do that.

See attached video.

 

*Steps*:
 # Add items to your order and proceed to checkout
 # Enter name and phone number
 # Continue to payment
 # After payment is processed, "Receipt sent" page with checkmark is shown.

*Expected result:*

After credit card is processed, user automatically proceeds to confirmation screen where they can tap "Email Receipt" and enter their email. Order is sent to POS when user reaches this screen.

*Actual result:*

User has to tap on "Receipt sent" screen to proceed to confirmation screen. Order is not sent to POS unless user taps to proceed to next screen (but there is no obvious CTA, and "Receipt sent" screen makes it seem like the user doesn't have to do anything else.)

** See [https://monstarlab.atlassian.net/browse/INDI-446|https://monstarlab.atlassian.net/browse/INDI-446|smart-link]  & [https://monstarlab.atlassian.net/browse/INDI-447|https://monstarlab.atlassian.net/browse/INDI-447|smart-link] 
* Change tip section header from “TIP YOUR DRIVER” to “ADD A TIP” for pickup tips.
* For pickup tips, replace the 10% / 15% / 10% tip options with $1 / $2 / $3. The options for pickup tips will be:
** None
** $1
** $2
** $3
** Custom
* “None” will be selected by default
* Tip values (aside from Custom) will be hardcoded; changing these tip values will require a new app build and new release.
* Custom tips allow max tip value of $99.99



*Zeplin (Mobile App)*: [https://zpl.io/VQKDWyA|https://zpl.io/VQKDWyA|smart-link] 



*Considerations*:

* Tipping is currently supported for delivery orders on web and mobile app; tipping is not currently active for pickup orders on any platform.
** Tipping for pickup orders must be enabled in Olo.
* Koala API supports tips for pickup orders.
* Koala web frontend and backend supports tips for pickup orders.
* Mobile app design to support tips on pickup orders is complete, and matches design for tips on delivery orders.
* In order to develop, test, and launch this feature, tipping needs to be enabled for pickup orders in Olo.

Summary: [Web] User cannot remove beer from basket
Description: _Reported by Milan 10/23_

*Steps:*
 # Add a beer to my cart
 # See an item notification in the basket CTA to the top left
 # Click into the basket, but I don't see the beer item listed
 # Go to checkout
 # I do see beer there, but it says the item is not available at this location (which is correct).
 # However when I go to Edit Order to remove the beer, the beer item line doesn't show up for me to delete.

 
I'm concerned this will create drop-off from our site as the beer item in the bag remain even if I refresh the page or switch handoff modes.

Summary: Generate our own Time slots 
Description: Generate time slots with given date requested (whichever hours, operation or delivery).


*Notes from conversation with Nick:*

Go off latest latest work on koalakit > deep-dispatch
We will stop making request to koala time slots since we will not have luck getting 2 before the actual dispatch start time
Therefore, we will generate our own time slots (especially delivery time slots).
---
We already get store 
There is flat map
Get store hours
And then get time slots, from koala server, we will remove the second line
Start doing math from start time to end time, 15min increment, excluding ones that are before and now!
---
Disallowing time slots in past, and allowing asap if location is open and is today
- no buffers from open, we don't need a buffer. 
- as long as delivery hours are 30min after 30 hours 
---
Use swift date, start time date, comes in as date, do while loop 
While current date...make sure that the 15min are happening at start of hour - this should be easy since slots in Olo are also in 15min increments. 
---
Build array of time slots object based on some date math 
No difference between 2 modes
Again, we don't think we need buffer

Summary: [test] placing orders near closing
Description: [~accountid:557058:28f3f679-ffe3-4258-87d7-8f4f590711f1]
Attempting to place an order for delivery seems to be similar to placing an order for pickup. 
Generally, it looks like i cannot place a delivery or a pickup order at least 30min before closing time, some orders are not allowed for even longer, depending on how large they are. 

[Here|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEj_yxg04SdrA2xR11_0U2i9kVuJ_o1aj12E3XKBysU/edit#gid=0] is a sheet of some findings. 

User will see one of three error messages, depending on where they are in the flow. 

*Scenario one*
When basket was created, and user has selected a time on checkout screen that would have been too early for the order to be delivered, the following error appeared: 
*Error*: Order cannot be ready before <date/time>. Please select a later time. 

*Scenario two*
When checking out (with $12 order) and having selected 4:00 delivery time, when store closes at 4:00pm, current time: 3:20pm. approximate time is 45min
<Store> is closed for delivery at the time you have specified. Please schedule your order for another time or select another order type. No order has been placed or billed. 

*Scenario three*
When choosing a time (before having created a basket) that is after the closing time.  (ex. selecting 4:15 when store closed at 4:00, and it is 3:00)
<Store> is closed for delivery at the time you have specified. Please schedule your order for another time or select another order type.
*Note:* Almost certainly we will not see this case in production since the time slot hours will be in sync with the actual delivery hours (I am testing without the koala force refresh at the moment). 

Some more findings:
For both delivery and pickup, I get #2 error message above on checkout (for a fire feast) 
3:30 trying to place order for 4:00 (the closing time).

Summary: Category icons - hover effect
Description: User Story: As a Deep customer, I want to see icons with the names of the menu categories so I can easily visualize what the nature of the products that each category contains.

Short term: Hardcode global category id in the frontend brand config and map them to icons hosted in the brand's asset folder.

Long terms: Executing the above will allow for an easy transition into CMS/API control over category icons, once Koala exposes global categories as an augmentable resource.

Acceptance Criteria:
* Zeplin: https://zpl.io/bz6jYw8
* Icons color must change dynamically with the copy associated with it.

Summary: Rate The App
Description: User Story: As a Deep mobile app user, I want to be able to rate the app after placing an order so I can express how I feel about the app in the App Store.

Acceptance Criteria:
* Must only appear after a user has completed an order
* Must only appear once per session if deferred
* Required elements:
** Star rating
** Submit button
** Not Now button

*Notes:*
Some caveats to the native review/ratings prompt:
* In dev, the prompt will always show
* In TestFlight, the prompt may show, but will requests will not be sent to the App Store
* When app is live, the prompt will show, but in a limited way:
**  If the user hasn’t already given feedback and a request hasn’t been made too recently, then the prompt will display
** The user can opt out (via Settings) of receiving these rating prompts for all apps they have installed.
** The system automatically limits the display of the prompt to three occurrences per app within a 365-day period.

Summary: [Mobile] No Error Messaging for Adding >Max Quantity
Description: Currently, when a user attempts to add >max quantity of a product to their basket there is no error messaging instructing the user they can only add x number of the same item.

*Expected:*

[~accountid:5b3f69b58035ff2f277a2fe0] not sure what the FE experience should be for this but I suggest implementing some kind of error messaging indicating that the user cannot add more than x number of the product they are trying to add – as for adding >max quantity by changing modifiers, I think that behavior is fine unless it should function differently

Summary: Camera Permissions Prompt Never Displays Again if User Denies Permissions
Description: When a user denies Camera Permissions prompt AND attempts to navigate back to the "Scan Barcode" screen then the Camera Permissions prompt is never displayed again and user sees FE error – "Device cannot capture video." 

This issue persists even if the user kills the app and relaunches. 

See attachment.

*Steps to Reproduce*
 # launch the application for the first time
 # nav to "Earn Rewards" screen 
 # tap `SCAN BARCODE` CTA 
 # on Camera Permissions prompt, tap `Don't Allow` button 
 # observe user remains on blank "Scan Barcode" screen 
 # nav back to "Earn Rewards" screen and tap `SCAN BARCODE` CTA 
 # observe error message "Device cannot capture video."
 # kill app and relaunch 
 # nav to "Earn Rewards" screen and tap `SCAN BARCODE` CTA 
 # observe error message "Device cannot capture video."

*Workaround*

User deletes app and reinstalls - user is then able to see Camera Permissions prompt to enable 

 

*Expected:*

[~accountid:5b3f69b58035ff2f277a2fe0] [~accountid:5e91c966be041a0b78f98a4f] not sure what expected behavior is here but I would suggest that if user denies Camera Permissions, user should be presented the Camera Permissions prompt anytime they nav back to the "Scan Barcode" screen. 

That should eliminate the "Device cannot capture video" error.

 ** Alert text: "This app needs to be updated to operate correctly."
 * "soft" alert: There is a newer version of the app available. User will have the option to go to the update page or ignore this alert and resume normal app behavior.
 ** Alert text: "Please update this app to get the latest features!"

To test, you can modify the app version environment values in https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions/force_update. The app is currently version 1.0:
- Under "Environment variables":
-- Change "DEV_MINIMUM_VERSION" to a version higher than 1.0 to enable the "force" alert
-- Change "DEV_UPDATE_VERSION" to a version higher than 1.0 to enable the "soft" alert
- Tap "Save" to commit changes.
- You can optionally tap "Test" to make sure your changes are reflected in the JSON.

Summary: /determine_best_match when modifying Fire Feast causes FE to display Review screen prematurely
Description: Sometimes, when a user modifies their Fire Feast selections the Review screen is displayed before the user taps "Review" CTA. 

I'm assuming this occurs because the /determine_best_match call is being made when a user taps any different selection made, but not sure why the FE is taking the user to the Review screen before they tap the "Review" CTA. 

Refer to attachment. 

*NOTES:*
 * this does not occur if a user goes through the modifiers to the /determine_best_match of any OTHER item in the Signature Meals category (ex. this does not occur if user selects Biryani item before they attempt to add Fire Feast) 
 * it seems this is only consistently reproducible when the first confirmation image returned is a Default image 
 * confirmed that the /determine_best_match call is being made every time a different select is made in "Modify" mode 

 

*Build*: #96

*Device*: iPhone 8+

*OS Version:* 11.3.1

*Connectivity:* WiFi (Online) 

 

*Steps to Reproduce*
 # Launch app and select "Indikitch_Demo" location 
 # Select "Fire Feast" item 
 # Select req modifiers (select 1st option for each modifier group) 
 # tap "Review" CTA 
 # tap "Modify" CTA 
 # Select a different option for Main modifier group (ex. Grilled Mushrooms) 
 # do not tap "Review" CTA 
 # observe user is navigated to Review screen without tapping "Review" CTA  

 

 

*Expected:*

User should not be taken to the Review screen until they have tapped "Review" CTA
